GCP-based Data Engineering Pipeline
This project is an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that processes, transforms, and analyzes Uber trip data. It demonstrates a complete workflow from raw data ingestion to a business intelligence-ready data warehouse, leveraging modern cloud technologies and data engineering principles.

Key Features
Automated Data Ingestion: Automates the extraction of raw Uber trip data and loads it into a cloud storage bucket.

Data Transformation: Uses Python to clean and structure the raw data, making it ready for analysis.

Workflow Orchestration: Manages and automates the entire pipeline using Mage, a user-friendly, notebook-based orchestration tool.

Cloud Integration: The entire pipeline is deployed and runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Dimensional Modeling: The transformed data is structured using a star schema to optimize it for fast querying and reporting.

Data Warehousing: Loads the processed data into BigQuery, a scalable and serverless cloud data warehouse.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Orchestration: Mage

Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery

Version Control: Git

Project Architecture
The project follows a cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach. The entire workflow is designed to be automated and scalable.

Extract: Raw data is ingested from the source and stored in a GCP staging area (e.g., a Cloud Storage bucket).

Transform: The Mage orchestrator triggers Python scripts to clean, transform, and model the data into a star schema.

Load: The refined, structured data is loaded into BigQuery for final storage and analysis.

Data Model
The data is modeled using a star schema, a common technique for data warehousing that simplifies queries and improves performance. This model consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project in a cloud environment.

Prerequisites
A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with a project and billing enabled.

Familiarity with the Mage platform (recommended).

Setup
Launch a Mage instance on a GCP compute engine.

Clone this repository within the Mage environment.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Configure your GCP service account credentials within the Mage project.

Usage
Within the Mage UI, navigate to the pipeline and run the defined blocks.

The data will be processed and loaded into your specified BigQuery dataset, ready for querying or use with a business intelligence tool.
